### Explanation of the Data Analysis Results

#### Overview
The analysis involves fitting experimental contact angle data against voltage using two models: an exponential decay model and a simplified Young-Lippmann model. The results for various glycerin concentrations (20%, 40%, 60%, 78%, 91%) are presented, including the fitted parameters, $R^2$ values, and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### Models Used

1. **Exponential Decay Model:**
   $$
   \text{angle} = a \cdot e^{-b \cdot \text{voltage}} + c
   $$
   - **Parameters:**
     - $a$: Initial magnitude of the decaying angle.
     - $b$: Decay rate.
     - $c$: Baseline angle at high voltage.

2. **Simplified Young-Lippmann Model:**
   $$
   \text{angle} = \arccos(\cos(\theta_0) + k \cdot \text{voltage}^2) \cdot \frac{180}{\pi}
   $$
   - **Parameters:**
     - $\theta_0$: Initial contact angle.
     - $k$: Proportional constant related to voltage.

### Results Interpretation

#### 20% Glycerin Concentration

- **Exponential Decay:**
  - $R^2: 0.8129$
  - MSE: 4.5602
  - Parameters: $a = 59.88$, $b = 0.00805$, $c = 51.85$
- **Simplified Young-Lippmann:**
  - $R^2: 0.9953$
  - MSE: 0.0690
  - Parameters: $\theta_0 = 74.72$, $k = 6.122 \times 10^{-6}$

**Conclusion:** The Simplified Young-Lippmann model provides a much better fit than the Exponential Decay model, as indicated by the higher $R^2$ and lower MSE values.

#### 40% Glycerin Concentration

- **Exponential Decay:**
  - $R^2: 0.9486$
  - MSE: 1.4719
  - Parameters: $a = 65.74$, $b = 0.01099$, $c = 52.94$
- **Simplified Young-Lippmann:**
  - $R^2: 0.9534$
  - MSE: 2.0758
  - Parameters: $\theta_0 = 76.20$, $k = 7.169 \times 10^{-6}$

**Conclusion:** Both models fit the data well, but the Simplified Young-Lippmann model has a slightly higher $R^2$ but a higher MSE compared to the Exponential Decay model.

#### 60% Glycerin Concentration

- **Exponential Decay:**
  - $R^2: 0.9929$
  - MSE: 0.1032
  - Parameters: $a = 65.99$, $b = 0.00907$, $c = 50.02$
- **Simplified Young-Lippmann:**
  - $R^2: 0.9931$
  - MSE: 0.2680
  - Parameters: $\theta_0 = 75.38$, $k = 5.734 \times 10^{-6}$

**Conclusion:** Both models fit the data extremely well, with very high $R^2$ values. The Exponential Decay model has a slightly lower MSE.

#### 78% Glycerin Concentration

- **Exponential Decay:**
  - $R^2: 0.9758$
  - MSE: 0.9707
  - Parameters: $a = 57.22$, $b = 0.00556$, $c = 41.75$
- **Simplified Young-Lippmann:**
  - $R^2: 0.9956$
  - MSE: 0.2131
  - Parameters: $\theta_0 = 65.19$, $k = 1.719 \times 10^{-6}$

**Conclusion:** The Simplified Young-Lippmann model provides a better fit, with higher $R^2$ and lower MSE values compared to the Exponential Decay model.

#### 91% Glycerin Concentration

- **Exponential Decay:**
  - $R^2: 0.9432$
  - MSE: 0.0628
  - Parameters: $a = 45.81$, $b = 0.00934$, $c = 48.02$
- **Simplified Young-Lippmann:**
  - $R^2: 1.0$
  - MSE: 0.0
  - Parameters: $\theta_0 = 69.40$, $k = 3.188 \times 10^{-5}$

**Conclusion:** The Simplified Young-Lippmann model fits the data perfectly, as indicated by the $R^2 = 1.0$ and MSE of 0. The Exponential Decay model also fits well but not as perfectly.

### General Observations

- **Model Comparison:** The Simplified Young-Lippmann model consistently provides a better fit across all concentrations, as shown by higher $R^2$ values and lower (or comparable) MSE values.
- **Parameter Interpretation:**
  - For the Simplified Young-Lippmann model, $\theta_0$ represents the initial contact angle, and $k$ represents the effect of voltage on the contact angle.
  - For the Exponential Decay model, $a$ represents the initial angle magnitude, $b$ the decay rate, and $c$ the baseline angle at high voltage.

### Conclusion

The Simplified Young-Lippmann model is generally more accurate in describing the relationship between contact angle and voltage for the glycerin-water mixtures across different concentrations. The Exponential Decay model, while also fitting reasonably well, does not capture the data as precisely as the Young-Lippmann model, especially at higher glycerin concentrations.
